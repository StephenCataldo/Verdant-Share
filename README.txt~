Verdant Share modules (rideshare will be published first; taxi-match and roomshare are used internally) use flags, views and cck to create chart and map
views of people who need to share a ride/taxi/room.  They have many depedencies
on (hopefully) common modules.  

The basic flow from a devel perspective:
* There is a cck type for rideshare, 
set as a content_profile, meaning each signed
in user gets one instance of that type.
* Users should be encouraged to have Contact module settings left on,
or things won't really work well.
* The form for editing their instance can be on a profile page, a popup (not
yet implemented but easy), or my preference a block on the view of other
people's posts.
* There are two views of other people's posts: a map, and a chart.  Flags
are used heavily to allow sorting.  

From a user's perspective: go to the link for ridesharing and you'll see
both a form for your post and everyone else's post.  Optional to have users
create their post when they sign up for the conference.

The intention is that these will be standardized
enough to be easy to edit: add or subtract fields to the cck-type or
to the view.  I'm interested to hear what other people do with the module.

Admin tip:
* The views use Exposed Forms, which I don't intent to be visible to be users
but are great to use as an admin tuning the view parameters.
* The dates exposed forms gave me lots of problems, and I haven't dealt with
them yet -- the "four hour window" goes an extra day in theory, and merely
seems to more or less work, right now.

Help and advice are very welcome!
